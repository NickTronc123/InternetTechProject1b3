            <h1>The Tale of Boisvert</h1>
            <p>Created from the minds of two "tree huggers", one from the melting swamps of New Orleans, Louisiana, and another from the biting winters of Juneau, Alaska. Boisvert sets out to gain retribution against those who disregard mother nature and who are ungrateful for this beautiful rock in space called earth through the best way they know possible...Thrash Metal music.  Boisvert's lofi aesthetic makes the band akin to a classic garage Metal Band, but has a wild energy that gives fans of classic Thrash a chance to relive the glory days through a fresh and youthful lens.  Boisvert tells tales of apocalyptic and cosmic horrors, warning the listener of the dire consequences if humanity continues to go down this path of destruction.  With mostly short but sweet songs, Boisvert confines their messages and untamed instrumentals to no more than 4 minutes, putting the phrase "simple is better" to the test.</p>
